# Ground-Up Learning App

A local-first, mastery-based learning application that teaches mathematics (arithmetic → introductory algebra) and scientific reasoning from the ground up: it identifies missing prerequisites, teaches in dependency order, grades deterministically, tracks five-dimension mastery, and schedules spaced review.

> **Status: Phase 1 (Application Foundation) complete.** The repository holds the specification, Phase 0 planning artifacts, and a tested TypeScript monorepo with the app shell, local-first persistence, learner profile, settings, and accessibility baseline. Curriculum, validators, the learning engine, the diagnostic, and the AI tutor arrive in Phase 2+.

## Repository layout

```
packages/
  domain/        Framework-agnostic types: skill state, mastery dimensions, events, errors
  schemas/       JSON Schemas for content + Ajv validator + fixtures (ID grammar, DEC-007)
  persistence/   Append-only event store (in-memory + IndexedDB), projections, learner repo
apps/
  client/        Vite + React app shell: routes, screens, learner state, a11y, error handling
content/         Curriculum content ONLY (data) — added in Phase 6/7, kept out of code
tests/e2e/       Playwright smoke + accessibility (axe-core)
docs/            Specification and planning
```

## Development

Requires Node ≥ 20 and pnpm 10.

```bash
pnpm install            # install workspace dependencies
pnpm dev                # run the client (http://localhost:5173)
pnpm typecheck          # tsc --noEmit across the workspace
pnpm test               # Vitest: unit + integration (all packages)
pnpm validate:content   # content-schema validation (CUR-001)
pnpm build              # production build of the client
pnpm test:e2e           # Playwright end-to-end + accessibility smoke
pnpm lint               # Prettier format check
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint → typecheck → tests → content validation → build → e2e.

## Non-negotiable principles

- **Deterministic grading** owns correctness and mastery; **AI never writes verified state**.
- **Curriculum content is data**, kept separate from application logic.
- **Local-first** progress, derived from an append-only, idempotent event log.
- **Accessibility baseline** across every screen and state.

## Source-of-truth priority

When documents conflict (per `docs/spec/00_README.md`): Product Requirements → Version & Scope Plan → Learning System Spec → Curriculum Architecture → Technical Architecture → Implementation Backlog. Unresolved conflicts are recorded in the decision log.
